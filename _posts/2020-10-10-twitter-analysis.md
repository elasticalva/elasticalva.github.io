## Two of dance music's most respected tools receive a long-awaited upgrade.


Last summer, Elektron announced its first run of MKII devices since the dearly departed Machinedrum and Monomachine. As we've gone deep into both the original Octatrack and the Analog Keys, we'll focus here on what's new and improved in the MKII range.

Since its initial release six years ago, the Octatrack has established itself as a modern classic in the realm of hardware samplers. Renowned for its deep sound-mangling capabilities and notoriously steep learning curve, it's become ubiquitous. It's either the one piece of kit producers can't live without or the one they ditched after six months of confusion and frustration. With the MKII, Elektron seems eager to please both camps. They have proved their commitment to long-term support for the machine and made the user interface more accessible for those who may have been discouraged by the hours of manual study and muscle memory required to get a handle on the workflow.

Besides new dedicated buttons, the other primary improvement in the new Octatrack is the audio input circuitry. For such a high-end hardware sampler, it was a bit strange that the Octatrack's sampling inputs weren't up to par with the rest of the device's impressive specs. The four unbalanced audio inputs of the old model have been vastly improved here, with headroom boosted from a peak of +8 dBu to a whopping +17 dBu and input impedance at 21 kOhm (as opposed to the previous version's 9 kOhm). In practice, this means you can sample at much higher levels without clipping. For users accustomed to loading their samples via USB, this might not be reason to upgrade, but if you've long been frustrated by distorted, low-volume samples (or if you like to use the Octatrack's' internal mixer and effects for external audio), this makes a huge difference.
